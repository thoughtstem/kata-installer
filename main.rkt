  ;I know it looks like we're managing dependencies here -- which Racket could do for us.
  
  ;However, this gives us more fine-grained control over how and when these packages update.

  ;One annoyance is that you'll need to make sure these dependencies are topologically sorted according to their dependency graph.  That is: If B depends on A, it must come after A in the list.  Other than that constraint, it can be ordered however you want.

  ;Here we define our policy for which packages should be updated every time DrRacket opens, and which shall be explicitly updated (with `raco update-watched-packages`).

  ;Also, we set up a callback for watching the updates and reporting to our backend.  But that really ought to be moved to a different package that kata-installer installs (i.e. add it to the package source list above)
